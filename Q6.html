    <h1>Artificial intelligence art</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 28px;">Artificial intelligence art is visual artwork created through the use of an artificial intelligence (AI) program.[1]

        Artists began to create artificial intelligence art in the mid to late 20th century, when the discipline was founded. Throughout its history, artificial intelligence art has raised many philosophical concerns related to the human mind, artificial beings, and what can be considered art in a human–AI collaboration. Since the 20th century, artists have used AI to create art, some of which has been exhibited in museums and won awards.[2]
        
        The increased availability of AI art tools to the general public in the 2020s AI boom provided opportunities for creating AI generated images outside of academia and professional artists. Commentary about AI art in the 2020s has often focused on issues related to copyright, deception, defamation, and its impact on more traditional artists, including technological unemployment.</p>

        <h1>Artificial Intelligence: How AI is Changing Art</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 28px;">Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly present in our lives, with the purpose of doing the most diverse tasks. Writing a text, answering a question, suggesting a traffic route, or improving the management of an area are just a few examples of how AI has already become part of our routine.</p>
        <p><b>But how is AI changing the way we see and make art?</b></p>
        <p style="font-size: 28px;">More recently, AI-based tools that are capable of creating digital art have become famous, and this is an area where it has shown to be promising.

            With the use of AI techniques and tools, artists and creators can develop new forms of expression and expand the limits of art as we know it today.
            
            In this article, we will explore the impact of AI on the creation of digital art and analyze some of the main tools and techniques currently used in the creative process.
            
            We will talk about the challenges and concerns of this technology in the creation of art and discuss what the future holds for this constantly evolving area.</p>

            <h1>AI art (artificial intelligence art)</h1>
            <p><b>What is AI art?</b></p>
            <p style="font-size: 28px;">AI art (artificial intelligence art) is any form of digital art created or enhanced with AI tools. Though commonly associated with visual art  images and video, for example  the term AI art also applies to audio compositions, including music.

                Since the earliest pictures found on cave walls, human creativity alone has driven art's history. Inspired humans using hand-held tools  musical instruments or paintbrushes  generated all manner of art throughout recorded history. AI art shatters that paradigm.
                
                Using machine learning algorithms, computer technology  trained on a body of art to learn what art is and how to describe it  applies various techniques, such as a generative adversarial network (GAN), to change or enhance existing human creations or generate entirely new works of art.</p>

            <h1>The Impact Of Artificial Intelligence On The Art World</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 28px;">In 2020, a global pandemic forced much of the world to shut down, causing many businesses to move online—some for the very first time. It was during this lockdown that the art market began to quickly transition away from established norms toward innovations like remote sales, augmented reality simulators and online viewing rooms.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 28px;">The period also heralded the beginning of a new era of artificial intelligence (AI), which has increasingly revealed its potential in the art market. It cannot be denied that AI is a remarkable technology. Yet, many also wonder whether this technology will turn out to be a net benefit with some in the industry perceiving it as a threat to established norms.</p>

         <h1>Art in the age of artificial intelligence</h1>
         <p style="font-size: 28px;">After being expelled from the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Madrid just before graduation in 1926 for insulting the examination panel, 22-yearold Salvador Dalí headed for Paris. This change of location proved transformative, both for the young artist and for art itself. In France, Dalí went from imitating his masters to developing his own distinctive style. Merging imagery inspired by Sigmund Freud's interpretations of erotic dreams with surreal hallucinations, Dalí embraced association and automaticity as his creative method. This shift led to an exuberant production of canvases and other artifacts, an energetic pace that he maintained until his death in 1989. It is therefore highly apt that when, in 2021, OpenAI launched its deep learning model capable of generating novel images from natural-language descriptions, it called the program “DALL-E.”</p>
         <p style="font-size: 28px;">A tribute to the famous surrealist artist as well as to Pixar's animated robot WALL-E, the current version of the model—known as DALL-E 2—features automaticity, generativity, and a dreamy aesthetic. Made widely available, DALL-E 2 and its fellow image generators Midjourney and Stable Diffusion have evoked fascination and horror in both the art community and the general public. And understandably so, given that such models have the potential to be more transformational than even Dalí</p>
